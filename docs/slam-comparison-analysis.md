slam create -f README.md -r frontend        # Filters to frontend repos
slam create -f README.md sub "old" "new"    # Actually performs substitution
slam create -f README.md sub "old" "new" -c "Update docs"  # Commits changes
```

#### GX Create Workflow
```bash
# Requires action upfront
gx create --files README.md                 # ERROR: requires subcommand

- **Parallel Processing**: Handle multiple repositories concurrently

## Missing Functionality

### üö® Critical Missing Features

#### 1. Sandbox Commands ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highest Priority)

**SLAM provides complete workspace management that GX lacks entirely:**

```bash
# SLAM Sandbox Commands
slam sandbox setup           # Clone all org repos, install pre-commit hooks
slam sandbox setup -r api    # Clone only repos matching 'api' pattern
slam sandbox refresh         # Reset all repos to HEAD, pull latest, clean branches
```

**Key Missing Capabilities:**
- **Workspace Initialization**: Bulk clone all repositories from an organization
- **Repository Synchronization**: Reset all repos to clean state with latest changes
- **Branch Cleanup**: Automatic removal of stale local branches without remotes
- **Pre-commit Hook Management**: Bulk installation and status tracking across repos
- **Visual Status Display**: Colored SHA display showing which repos were updated

**Impact**: This is a major workflow feature that SLAM users rely on for maintaining development environments.

#### 2. Create Command Dry-Run Mode ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High Priority)

**SLAM's incremental command building is missing:**

```bash
# SLAM (works - shows preview)
slam create -f README.md
# Output:
# Matched repositories:
#   scottidler/imap-filter
#     README.md
#   scottidler/imap-filter-py
#     README.md
#
#   4üìÑ | 4üîç

# GX (fails - requires action)
gx create --files README.md
# Error: 'gx create' requires a subcommand but one was not provided
```

**Missing Behavior:**
- **Optional Subcommands**: SLAM allows `create` without action for preview
- **Incremental Discovery**: Show matched repos/files as you build the command
- **Safe Exploration**: Preview changes before committing to actions
- **Command Validation**: Verify patterns match expected files before taking action

**Impact**: This is essential for safe exploration and validation of changes before execution.

#### 3. Advanced Transaction Features ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium Priority)

**SLAM has more sophisticated transaction handling:**

**Enhanced Rollback Capabilities:**
- **Stash Management**: Automatic stashing/unstashing of uncommitted changes
- **Branch State Restoration**: More comprehensive branch state management
- **Pre-commit Integration**: Rollback includes pre-commit hook state
- **Multi-step Rollback**: More granular rollback points throughout operations

**Missing Transaction Features:**
```rust
// SLAM's transaction system includes:
- Stash save/restore operations
- Branch checkout state preservation
- Pre-commit hook installation rollback
- Remote branch creation/deletion rollback
- More granular rollback points
```

### üîÑ Secondary Missing Features

#### 4. Repository Discovery Enhancements ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**SLAM can discover ALL repositories in an organization:**

```bash
# SLAM discovers from GitHub API
slam sandbox setup -r pattern  # Gets ALL org repos, then filters locally
```

**Missing in GX:**
- **Org-wide Discovery**: GX only discovers local repos, SLAM can discover all org repos
- **Remote Repository Enumeration**: SLAM can list all repos in a GitHub organization
- **Archived Repository Handling**: SLAM can include/exclude archived repositories
- **Repository Metadata**: SLAM fetches additional repo information from GitHub

#### 5. Output Format Consistency ‚≠ê

**SLAM has specific output patterns that users expect:**

```bash
# SLAM output format
4üìÑ | 4üîç  # files | total repos (specific emoji order and format)

# GX output format
Different formatting pattern with unified display system
```

**Missing Elements:**
- **Exact Emoji Ordering**: SLAM uses specific `filesüìÑ | reposüîç` format
- **Status Line Format**: SLAM's compact status display style
- **Color Coding**: SLAM's specific color scheme for different operation states
- **Progress Indicators**: SLAM's real-time status updates during operations

// New dry-run function
pub fn show_matches(
    cli: &Cli,
    config: &Config,
    files: &[String],
    patterns: &[String],
) -> Result<()>
```

**Files to Modify:**

Add `gx slam create` ‚Üí `gx create` aliases for migration assistance.

#### 8. Minimal Config Mode
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

Option to run with SLAM-like minimal configuration for simpler setups.

## Migration Considerations

### For Existing SLAM Users

#### Command Mapping
```bash
# SLAM create commands
slam create -f "*.json" sub "old" "new" -c "Update config"
# becomes (after dry-run fix)
gx create --files "*.json" sub "old" "new" --commit "Update config"

# SLAM review commands
slam review -o tatari-tv ls SLAM-2024-01-15
# becomes
gx review --org tatari-tv ls SLAM-2024-01-15
# or (with auto-detection)
gx review ls SLAM-2024-01-15

# SLAM sandbox commands (MISSING - needs implementation)
slam sandbox setup -r frontend
# should become
gx sandbox setup --patterns frontend
```

#### Configuration Migration
- **SLAM**: Minimal configuration, mostly defaults
- **GX**: Comprehensive YAML configuration
- **Migration Path**: Provide configuration templates and migration guide

#### Workflow Migration
Most SLAM workflows can be directly translated to GX with minimal changes, except for:
1. **Sandbox workflows** (missing functionality)
2. **Dry-run exploration** (missing functionality)
3. **Pre-commit integration** (intentionally excluded)

### Compatibility Considerations

#### Preserved Features ‚úÖ
- Four-level repository filtering
- Transaction-based rollback
- Parallel processing
- Comprehensive diff generation
- GitHub PR management
- File pattern matching
- Change ID tracking

#### Enhanced Features ‚ú®
- Multi-organization support
- Unified output formatting
- Better error handling and reporting
- Integration with comprehensive configuration system
- Consistent CLI patterns across all subcommands

#### Excluded Features ‚ùå
- **Automatic Pre-commit Hook Execution**: SLAM automatically runs `pre-commit` hooks during create operations. This behavior is **intentionally excluded** from GX for:
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Pre-commit hooks should be explicit operations
  - **Performance**: Automatic hooks can slow down bulk operations
  - **User Control**: Users should control when hooks execute
  - **Flexibility**: Some workflows need changes without immediate hook execution
